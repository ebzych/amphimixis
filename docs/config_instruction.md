# Configuration file guide

This guide explains how to create and configure your projectâ€™s build file. 

See an example configuration file [here](./config_example.md).

## General structure

The YAML configuration file consists of the following **top-level fields**:

| Field | Type | Description |
|:-------:|:------:|-------------|
| build_system<sup><a href="#note1">1</a></sup> | string | Name of the build system |
| runner<sup><a href="#note2">2</a></sup> | string | Name of the runner (low-level build system) |
| platforms | list of dictionaries | Describes the platforms used by the user |
| recipes | list of dictionaries | Build configuration parameters |
| builds | list of dictionaries | Describes of builds tasks |
---

<p id="note1">
1. Only <code>CMake</code> is supported.
</p>
<p id="note2">
2. Only <code>Make</code> is supported.
</p>

```yaml
build_system: CMake
runner: Make
platforms: [{}]
recipes: [{}]
builds: [{}]
```

### Platforms

The **platforms** section describes the machines on which the project will be built and run.  

| Field | Type | Description |
|:-------:|:------:|-------------|
| id | integer | Unique id of the platform |
| address | string | IP-address or domain name |
| arch | string | Architecture (e.g. x86, riscv)
| username | string | Username of the remote machine |
| port<sup><a href="#note3">3</a></sup>| integer | Port of the remote machine |
| password<sup><a href="#note4">4</a></sup> | string | Password for the remote machine |
---

<p id="note3">
3. Optional, default value: "22". The `port` must be within the range 1-65535.  
</p>
<p id="note4">
4. If the user has an SSH agent, then the password does not need to be provided.
</p>


> **<u>Note:</u>**  
> - If the `address` field is not specified, the local machine is assumed.  
> - For a local machine, `username`, `password`, and `port` do not need to be specified.  
> - If an `address` is specified, the machine is treated as remote, and the fields `username`, `password`, and `port` must be provided.


### Recipes

The **recipes** section describes the build configuration and compiler flags.

| Field | Type | Description |
|:-------:|:------:|-------------|
| id | integer | Unique id of the recipes |
| config_flags | string | Build configuration options |
| compiler_flags | string | Compiler flags used during the build process |
| script<sup><a href="#note5">5</a></sup> | string | Custom build script |
---

<p id="note5">
5. Optional.
</p>


### Builds

The **builds** section links platforms and recipes, defining which configurations should be built on which machines.

| Field | Type | Description |
|:-------:|:------:|-------------|
| build_machine | integer | `platform_id` of the machine where the project will be built |
| toolchain | string | Path to the toolchain used for building the project |
| sysroot | string | Path to the folder with system headers and libraries used by the toolchain |
| run_machine | integer | `platform_id` of the machine where the built project will be executed|
| recipe_id | integer | Id of the `recipe` |
