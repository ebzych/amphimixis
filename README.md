# Amphimixis

Amphimixis is an automated project intelligence and evaluation tool for performance and migration readiness. It helps inspect a project for existing infrastructure such as CI, tests, benchmarks, dependencies, and build scripts, then runs builds and collects performance data for further comparison.

> Amphimixis use `perf` for profiling, make cross-table with two builds per CPU event for comparison.

## Quick run

If you want to try Amphimixis right away, create a virtual environment, install the package from GitHub, and run the full pipeline on a target project:

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install git+https://github.com/ebzych/amphimixis.git@stable
amixis init local
amixis run /path/to/project --config local.yml
```

## Note

By default, your working directory must have an `input.yml` or other configuration file that you can specify with the `--config` flag. The format is described in [Config instruction](docs/config_instruction.md).

</p>

If your `input.yml` contains remote machines authenticated with SSH keys, start `ssh-agent` in the current shell and add the required keys manually before running `amixis`:

```bash
eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_remote_machine
```

## Requirements

- Python 3.12 or later
- Linux
- `rsync` on each machine
- `sshpass` available on the machine where you run Amphimixis, if you connect to remote machines with passwords
- `perf` available on each `run_machine`
- `perf archive`<sup><a href="#note1">1</a></sup> available on each `run_machine`
- A supported build setup in the target project: CMake as the build system and Make as the low-level runner

## What Amphimixis does

Amphimixis can:

- <i>analyze</i> a project for CI, tests, benchmarks, build system configuration, and dependencies
- <i>build</i> the project with configured recipes and platforms
- <i>profile</i> executable runs and collect timing and `perf`-based statistics
- <i>compare</i> profiling outputs produced for different builds and put them into a <u><i>cross-table for each CPU event</i></u>

## Typical usage

Prepare a working directory with an `input.yml` configuration file. The configuration format is described in [Config instruction](docs/config_instruction.md).

Run the full workflow for a project:

```bash
amixis run /path/to/project
```

This command:

1. analyzes the project
1. builds it using the selected configuration
1. profiles the resulting executables
1. prints profiling results in the console

To compare two collected `perf` outputs:

```bash
amixis compare build1.scriptout build2.scriptout --max-rows 10
```

`compare` accepts exactly two `.scriptout` files. `--max-rows` limits how many symbols with the largest delta are shown for each event.

For step-by-step command examples, custom configuration files, and `--events` usage, see [Usage guide](docs/usage_guide.md).

## Build and run notes

The tool is distributed as a Python package with the `amixis` CLI entry point.

For local development and reproducible checks, the repository uses `uv` and GitHub Actions. The CI configuration is available in [.github/workflows/ci.yml](.github/workflows/ci.yml).

Useful commands during development:

```bash
uv run amixis --help
uv run pytest
```

If you want a more detailed walkthrough with installation options, workspace preparation, and command examples, see [Usage guide](docs/usage_guide.md).

## Project structure

The repository is organized around a small CLI and several core modules:

- [amixis.py](amixis.py) is the command-line entry point
- [amphimixis/analyzer.py](amphimixis/analyzer.py) inspects a target project
- [amphimixis/builder.py](amphimixis/builder.py) runs configured builds
- [amphimixis/profiler.py](amphimixis/profiler.py) gathers execution and profiling data
- [amphimixis/validator.py](amphimixis/validator.py) validates `input.yml`
- [amphimixis/shell](amphimixis/shell) contains local and remote shell backends
- [docs](docs) contains user-facing documentation
