You are applying the Amphimixis migration readiness pipeline to the single project "${PROJECT_NAME}" inside this disposable container.

CONTEXT:
- Reference platform: x86_64 (the local container machine). There is no second platform — target architecture is the same x86_64.
- The Amphimixis config file input.yml is ALREADY provided in the current working directory (/work). It defines two local builds: 1_1_1 (baseline) and 1_1_2 (optimized with -O3). Use amphimixis-validate to confirm your configurator keeps it correct; fix only invalid fields, do not recreate it from scratch.
- ${REPO_INSTRUCTION}
- Working workspace: /work/${PROJECT_NAME}-workspace — the analyzer clones the repository into it; the builder and profiler operate on it.
- Current working directory is /work.

RUN THE FULL PIPELINE:
1. amphimixis-analyzer: resolve and clone the repository, analyze structure, tests, CI, build systems, platform-specific macros and dependencies.
2. amphimixis-configurator: validate /work/input.yml (fix only invalid fields).
3. amphimixis-builder: build both builds 1_1_1 and 1_1_2 locally in the workspace and run tests if present. If a build fails due to a missing dependency, install it with apt-get/ninja/etc. (this container is disposable, restrictions are relaxed here) and retry.
4. amphimixis-profiler: profile the executables of 1_1_1 and 1_1_2 with full experimental rigor (warmup, 6-10 runs, taskset pinning, nice, frequency check); create a cross-table comparing the two builds with \`amixis compare --cross-table-format markdown\`; analyze vectorization.
5. amphimixis-optimizer: deep causal analysis of the bottlenecks and recommendations.
6. Final report: compile the standard 7-section Amphimixis report. Save it as /work/amphimixis-${PROJECT_NAME}-report.md (the formal Amphimixis report inspector only recognizes the amphimixis- prefixed name). Use the calculate-optimization-improvement tool for every changed metric and embed the results as the standard Improvement section, and embed the cross-table section exactly from cross-tables/CT-*.md.

RULES:
- NEVER fabricate profiling data. Mark anything unmeasured as NOT AVAILABLE; label reconstructed data as RECONSTRUCTED (not measured).
- improvements.json, cross-tables/CT-*.md and the saved profile JSON/YAML/pkl are tool-owned and read-only for you.
- No raw perf stat dumps in the report; use the structured data only.
- When every phase is finished and the report is saved, print exactly the line: WORK ON THE ${PROJECT_NAME} IS COMPLETED
